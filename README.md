Simple python script to replace frontmatter properties in markdown files.

I created this to quickly rename properties that did not match my naming conventions.

I've tested in backup Obsidian vaults and it works fine.

Nevertheless, if you are going to use it, make sure to backup your vault and test it on non-essential data first.
